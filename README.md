# Cucumber_Hybrid_Framework
This is a code which I written &amp; implement while practicing BDD Cucumber with the help of Referring Arun Motoori YouTube Channel Videos

# Notes :
1. People are very actually still confused with what is BDD then they are comparing with the a BDD with a normal framework or framework approaches so we have to understand couple of things that if it's a BDD then **BDD is a process it's not a framework ** or it's not that somewhere you have to write the code and everything, it's a extension of the TDD (Tested Driven Development) or you can say it's a methodology or it's a process or you can say it's a more of a test sending approach where the all the Three Amigos like QA, Dev and the PO or other stakeholders or business stakeholders they are collaborating together and then they are developing a common level of understanding in the form of maybe a gherkin keywords or feature file like you're writing given when then so the question here comes that how to explain this thing at a time of interview that's a wrong thing that you are using that no I'm using bdd framework I'm working on the bdd framework and then you're comparing with which one is better a bdd is better or test NG is better or bdd is better or hybrid or data driven is better no this is a totally wrong thing you are actually doing the comparison like orange and Apple so how to explain : 

2. **BDD is not a framework it's a process or it's a methodology** and you can say it's extension of test driven development approach then we can say that for implementing this particular bdd process there are a number of tools which are available in the market & framework and libraries also available as a market one of the popular library is for example cucumber so we are using cucumber with Ruby or Java or JavaScript and then we are implementing in the form of the ui develop framework development or whatever API or mobile automation development that you are writing it for that purpose we are writing it so in cucumber we are creating feature files that feature file is written in the form with the help of gherkin keywords like scenario, scenario outline, examples, given, when, then keyword that you are writing it and then you are mapping with your step definition file in Java or Ruby or whatever and then you have Runners also that thing and then you are maintaining your proper page object model design patterns number of pages utilities and everything that you are creating it along with that you are adding the flavor of data driven approach also 

So along again data driven is not a framework data driven is an approach it means I really want to derive the data from the external Source like Excel CSV Json or XML or data base or whatever same thing with the keyword ribbon is an approach it's not a framework so keyword driven means we are writing all the keywords maybe in some Excel file or somewhere and then against that particular keyword we have a specific function written in my framework and then we can just run those keywords in the specific sequence to execute a specific scenario so that's like a keyword driven approach that we are following it hybrid means when we combine all the approaches and patterns together then it's like a hybrid approach but it's a wrong thing that you are comparing that data driven approach with the or data driven framework with the bdd framework no we should not compare it bdd is a process where all the Three Amigos like UA Dev and po guys they are collaborating together and creating the common understanding of feature file and everything and now it's totally up to you if you really want to automate so is it mandatory that okay with the bdd we have to do automation no nothing is written like that it's not at all mandatory and then if it's a requirement of doing automation and along with the bdd process then there are tools available in the market of Frameworks or libraries are available in the market like you can say a cucumber or spec and these are behaviors, these are the libraries which are available so you can use them right so comparing these two totally different things and it's not a right idea. 
Same thing at a time of interview how will you phrase it that we are we have implemented so let's see someone is asking you a time of interview explain about your current project and your current project you are using bdd process and the specific tool so how to explain that for example: 

here we are using a web Automation and then along with that we are using the bdd process also for that to implement that particular process we are implementing in the form of cucumber framework along with selenium Java Library also that we are writing it why we pick bdd because we have a common understanding among QA, UI and the business holders or the PO guys we are writing the common feature file in the form of gerking keywords like given, when, then.
we are checking that okay all the scenarios and outlines and examples according to the business requirement according to the acceptance criteria is written properly or not and then we review it on a regular basis it's not like it's only our responsibility or QA responsibility so it's a combined effort and then on the basis of that we are writing our test cases or writing the step definitions with the help of cucumber so for that purpose we are using cucumber with Java because we prefer Java language or c-sharp or dot net or python or whatever that language that you want to use it along with the cucumber and then we are writing the step definition against that so that is the right way of explaining it what exactly people say that no we are using bdd framework and with the Cucumber but **bdd is not a framework it's a wrong thing to tell at the time of interview** and it's a wrong understanding also it looks foolish that someone people when some sometimes people say that no we are using bdd framework with cucumber what does it mean okay it has nothing to uh you know having any proper meaning and actual thing about it bdd is a process bdd does not say that you have to automation we have to do automation or something like this it's nothing like that okay so always remember you have to make sure mention that it's a collaborative approach a collaborative process among Three Amigos that Three Amigos means one is Dev QA and the the PO guy or the business analyst or other stakeholders they are sitting together reviewing your feature file and whatever that you have written and if any changes are there in the future also it will be reviewed by every one by Three Amigos in some project what exactly we are doing a mistake here that only QA people are just just for the sake of implementing cucumber because of the management pressure or anything just because of sake of that implementing or using cucumber or using bdd we are just using cucumber and then the entire feature file returned by us only by the QA guy only and then nobody actually bothers about that the feature file should be maintained by someone else or maintained by other Three Amigos also no so why this extra burden on me as a QA guy all the time that's not a bdd you are just using just for the sake of using it it means you are not using the proper actual process that's not the bdd that's a wrong definition or wrong implementation of the bdd if you are not using it properly then don't please use it okay just because of the management set that no we have to use cucumber but why if you're they are saying okay. no we are implementing the bdd process in this particular project then it should be implemented by everyone it should be followed by everyone just like in agile we say quality is a team's responsibility same thing in the bdd also it's a process driven by a collaborative approach by QA Dev and the PO guy some people they clean but okay no in cucumber we are getting very fancy report or amazing report so just for the report are you using it just for the report or test HTML report are you going to use this particular tool no there is a reason behind that because in my organization and my project We are following the bdd process so that's why now we were exploring which bdd process in which bdd based framework or bdd based uh tool that we can use it so then we explored couple of tools uh which is supporting Java or python or any other languages also where exactly we all are comfortable so let's see we found that cucumber with jvm or cucumber with Ruby or python or our spec with uh you know Ruby or other things so in that case I can go with that so that should be the right explanation and that should be the right answer for that I hope it's clear so please next time whenever I see on social media on LinkedIn people are asking this question also that in fact senior people who have actually worked on a cucumber in bdd from last couple of years and are still they are doing this mistake they don't understand the value of these processes and unnecessary implementing it and unnecessary creating a hype also so now it's our responsibility to educate people and to the management also that why are we using cucumber just for the sake of using it or are we really following the bdd process in our project or not.
